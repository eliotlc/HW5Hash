Based on the statistics for each method, using the built-in hash method was the most effective, with a construction time of less than 10 milliseconds. While it did have about the same number of collisions as the other methods, the fact that it was the fastest makes it the best in my opinion.

For handling collisions, the linear probing strategy was much better at not wasting slots than my original method of appending the data to a list at the key, but at the cost of being much slower. In addition, because it required the hash table to be bigger to accomodate all the data items, it used more memory overall.

I think that using linear probing would actually make accessing elements slower as well, since when looking up data in the table there is a high chance that you'll have to search through much of the table before finding the data.
